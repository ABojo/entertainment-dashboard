## What is this project?

This project is a full-stack entertainment dashboard. The core technologies used to build it include Next.js, TypeScript, SCSS, and Prisma.

The front-end includes pages for viewing trending media, recommended media, TV shows, movies, and the user's personal bookmarks. In terms of interactivity, users can search for media by title, and they can bookmark the media they'd like to remember. Lastly, the dashboard includes a profile page for logging out.

The back-end is composed of a JSON API and SQL Database. The API was built using Next.js route handlers. Users passwords are hashed using bcrypt, and routes that pertain to user specific data are protected using JWTs. Prisma was used to model data and interface with the database.
